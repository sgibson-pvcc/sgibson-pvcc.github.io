<h2>Operating Systems Terminology</h2>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>TERM</th>
    <th>DEFINITION</th>
  </tr>
 
  <tr>
    <td>Operating Systems</td>
    <td>the software that controls the overall operation of a computer</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>Job queue</td>
    <td>a storage organization in which objects (in this case, jobs) are ordered</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FIFO </td>
    <td>the objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>Interactive processing</td>
    <td>new operating systems were developed that allowed a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals</td>
   </tr>  
   <tr>
    <td>time-sharing</td>
    <td>provides service to multiple users at the same time</td>
  </tr> 

    <td>multiprogramming</td>
    <td>time is divided into intervals and then the execution of each job is restricted to only one interval at a time. At the end of each interval, the current job is temporarily set aside and another is allowed to execute during the next interval</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>application software</td>
    <td>consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine’s </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>system software</td>
    <td>provides the infrastructure that the application software requires</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>ultility software</td>
    <td>consists of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system. In a sense, utility software consists of software units that extend (or perhaps customize) the capabilities of the operating system</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>graphical User interface (GUI)</td>
    <td>objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons. These systems allow users to issue commands by using one of several common input devices. For example, a computer mouse, with one or more buttons, can be used to click or drag icons on the screen. In place of a mouse, special-purpose pointing devices or styluses are often used by graphic artists or on several types of hand-held devices.></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>shell</td>
    <td>communicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>kernel</td>
    <td>contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>device driver</td>
    <td>software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine. Each device driver is uniquely designed for its particular type of device (such as a printer, disk drive, or monitor) and translates generic requests into the more technical steps required by the device assigned to that driver.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>file manager</td>
    <td>the software that controls the overall operation of a computer</td> 
  </tr>  
<tr>
  <td>memory manager</td>
  <td>the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory</td> 
</tr>  </tr> 
<tr>
  <td>vertual memory</td>
  <td>where the computer is able to function as though it actually had 8GB of main memory.</td> 
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td>boot strapping</td>
  <td>procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on)</td> 
</tr>  
<tr>
  <td>ROM</td>
  <td>a small portion of a computer’s main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program is constructed from special nonvolatile memory cells.</td> 
</tr>   
<tr>
  <td>deadlock</td>
  <td>the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.</td> 
</tr>  
<tr>
  <td>spooling</td>
  <td>where the operating system would make the nonshareable resource appear shareable by creating the illusion of more than one printer.</td> 
</tr>  
<tr>
  <td>super user (or administrator)</td>
  <td>person who gains highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him- or herself as the administrator (usually by name and password) during the login procedure</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>multi-user athentication</td>
  <td>One solution to the pervasive problem of humans using weak password to secure their computer accounts is to require more than one piece of evidence to gain access.</td>
